	"
Since their creation, the stout, yet short, Cretonians once inhabited the large and fertile plains of Coralia. They first made contact with Men in the year 349 of the Third Age, as a trading vessel from the kingdom of Agari went off course and encountered one of their settlements and after some initial suspicion a trade agreement was struck.

The Cretonians are many things, but they do not possess a business mind. Men offered many new things, and trinkets that they had not seen before and they gladly traded gems for glass beads, and fine meat and hides for watered down Piwa. Eventually the Cretonians were in debt and started trading their lands for what they now had grown to depend on.

The Agarians were not the only kingdom, soon the northern Franshi kingdom, and the  Ennurian nomads established colonies to sap the richness of the Cretonian ancestral lands.  In 353, the War of Golden Rose broke out, and it quickly spread to Coralia. All three parties enlisted Cretonians in their ranks. Despite their short stature, they possess great strength.

The war was brutal, and many great heroes fell,  The Franshi burned and slaughtered those Cretonian tribes that had picked the wrong side. Coralia laid in ruins.

It was at this time that a Cretonian chieftain by the name of Hotam Greattusk was declared Numbi by the Shamans, and tasked with finding a new home for his people. He gathered what was left of his tribe and set out to cross the Prygian mountains in search of a new home.  Finally he reached the plains of Samba and settled by the river of Krios. He called this land \"New Cretonia\".

Know that I'm no wet-nurse, it's important that you do only what I tell you. Do not click anything without my permission, or you might compromise our mission. 
		 
		First, my young chieftain, you must learn a thing or two about navigating your surroundings. You move your view with those 'wasd' key-things, and change height with the mouse wheel or with the small +/- buttons by the minimap.
		
		If you find yourself in want of these instructions again, I'm over here, just click my portrait. Now right click your hand-device to close this message and get to work.

	},
	
	WAREHOUSE_BUILD: {
		NAME: "Storage",
		
		DESC: 
		"Good. Our first task should be food. Food is very important. If we run out of edibles, we are doomed, not to rush you, your majesty.
		
		To prevent our stores from spoiling, we should store these goods in a warehouse, so let's get the brothers busy building one. You will find the option to build one down below. There is a lot to constructing a room, but surely a great mind like yourself can figure it out.
		
		First you lay out the area of the room. Each room then has items that need to be clicked and placed inside this area. You must place down at least 6 crates. May Crator guide your hand.

		Take care not to over-hunt. Naturally, the beasts reproduce, but if you exterminate them completely, they are gone forever. Aggressive hunting can also trigger an aggressive response.

		Now let us dwell on construction. Construction needs materials. For our early crude buildings, wood and stone will suffice. We must replenish our stock of this. Our first mission is to allocate crates in our warehouse for said materials. I hope there is space for 4 additional crates, as you need 2 of wood and stone each.

		To accept the new immigrants, you can do so in the citizen panel -> select species -> population, or by double clicking the species in the panel to the right. Be careful not to accept too many at once. They are more mouths to feed, so remember to put them to work!
